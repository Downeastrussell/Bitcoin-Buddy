                Bitcoin Buddy helps users track, manage, and report their Bitcoin investments for tax purposes!


Bitcoin is a brand-new way of transmitting money without the need for traditional banking networks, as well as a means to store data in a transparent and unalterable way, which means once you add data to the Bitcoin Network, it can never be erased or altered.


Cryptocurrency held as a capital asset is taxed as property. ... This means that if you are holding on to virtual currency, but haven't sold it, then you don't have to report it on your taxes. However, when you sell or exchange Bitcoin, you have to report the gain or loss on your taxes, just like any other capital asset.

Cryptocurrency has recently attracted attention from investors in all walks of life. Unfortunately, the legal and regulatory environment for cryptocurrency has not yet been fully developed, including in the area of taxation.

The IRS views cryptocurrency as property and not as a currency. Consequently, for investors, it will be regarded as a capital asset for tax purposes, which means that a key component of correctly determining the tax treatment of a cryptocurrency investment will be establishing its basis.

However, available data from the exchanges or other sources will often not be sufficient to pinpoint the exact BTC/USD exchange rate at the time of the exchange. For these instances, when establishing a basis, the investor will need to use a consistent standard for determining the exchange rate. A common choice for this purpose is the day's closing prices, which are based on the exchange rates at midnight UTC, as data are readily available and generally reflect the day's trading activity.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are not currently understood to be included in the scope of a "broker" as defined by Sec. 6045 and related regulations. As such, cryptocurrency investors will generally not be able to rely on Forms 1099 for support or reconciliation of basis information. In the absence of broker records, some third-party applications may be able to assist a cryptocurrency investor compile tax and holdings data using exchange data and public keys. However, much like the asset class itself, these services are in their infancy and may not be available for all exchanges and cryptocurrencies, or could be costly, depending on the volume of cryptocurrency transactions to be analyzed. As a result, it is critical for investors to maintain independent basis records for proper tax reporting.

Overall, cryptocurrency is still an emerging asset class with a largely undefined tax framework. As a result, little authoritative guidance is available for investors with respect to basis tracking. Thus, investors should adopt a method that is both thorough and consistent based on what is known about current tax law, until further guidance becomes available from the IRS.
